üì¶ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You will need the following software installed:

Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

pip: The Python package installer. It usually comes with Python.

Git: To clone the repository.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/payroll-pro.git
cd payroll-pro

Create a virtual environment:
It is best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
The project uses a requirements.txt file to manage its Python dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Database Setup
Configuration: Open the config.py (or equivalent) file and update the database connection string with your credentials.

# Example for Flask-Migrate
# flask db init
# flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
# flask db upgrade

If you don't use a migration tool, you may need to manually create the database tables.

Running the Application
After installation and database setup, you can start the application.

# Example for a Flask application
# set FLASK_APP=app.py  (Windows)
# export FLASK_APP=app.py (macOS/Linux)
# flask run

or

# Example for a simple Python server
# python app.py

The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 or a similar address.
